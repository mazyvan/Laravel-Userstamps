# Mazyvan/Userstamps
### MAYBE UNSTABLE. READ BELOW

**Warning**: This is a fork from WildSideUK/Laravel-Userstamps that doesn't fire the laravel "update" [events](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/eloquent#events) on deletions. It's only purpouse is for the Virtuamx team to work with this lib while the WildSideUK team check for the [issue 23](https://github.com/WildSideUK/Laravel-Userstamps/issues/23). If they approve the pull request. This fork will be deprecated.

**Stability Important Note**: I have experienced issues with this plugin using Passport. This issue is reported here -> https://github.com/WildSideUK/Laravel-Userstamps/issues/17 
So I tried the solution of setting manually the `'web'` guard. This plugin also have that workaround.   
I think you should not have problems unless you use different models for your 'web' and 'api' logins. That's my thoughts.

Provides an Eloquent trait to automatically maintain created_by and updated_by (and deleted_by when using SoftDeletes) on your models.

## Requirements

* This package requires PHP 5.6+
* It works with Laravel 5.x (and may work with earlier versions too).

## Installation

Require this package with composer

````
composer require mazyvan/userstamps
````

Migrate your Model's table to include a `created_by` and `updated_by` (and `deleted_by` if using `SoftDeletes`).

```php
$table -> unsignedInteger('created_by') -> nullable() -> default(null) -> after('created_at');
$table -> unsignedInteger('updated_by') -> nullable() -> default(null) -> after('updated_at');
```

Load the trait in your Model.

```php
use Mazyvan\Userstamps\Userstamps;

class Example extends Model {

    use Userstamps;
}
```

The following methods become available on your models to help retrieve the users creating, updating and deleting (if using SoftDeletes).

```php
$model -> creator; // the user who created the model
$model -> editor; // the user who last updated the model
$model -> destroyer; // the user who deleted the model
```

If you want to manually set the `created_by` or `updated_by` properties on your model you can stop Userstamps being automatically maintained using the `stopUserstamping` method.

If you want to define the `created_by`, `updated_by`, or `deleted_by` column names, add the following class constants to your model(s).
```php
const CREATED_BY = 'created_by';
const UPDATED_BY = 'updated_by';
const DELETED_BY = 'deleted_by';
```
